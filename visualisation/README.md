The files in this directory can be used to visualise behaviour trees using Groot and the result of a genetic programming run using gnuplot.
- To visualise a behaviour tree in Groot, copy the contents of its xml file and paste them in the `groot_template.xml` file. Then, load the file from Groot.
- To show the evolution of the average and best fitness values of a genetic programming run, run `./plot.sh <file>`, where `<file>` is the name of the report generated by `gp.cpp`.
